Billing State Bootstrap (Template)

This directory is the fixed billing-state release folder:
  releases/billing-state-v1/

It contains the required CSV files so CI verification can proceed.
If CI later reports "CSV header mismatch", replace the header row with the
exact expected header list printed by ci_verify.py for that file.
