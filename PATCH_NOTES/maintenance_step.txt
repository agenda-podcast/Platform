Apply this change by adding ONE step to Maintenance workflow (after bootstrap publish):

  - name: Sanitize billing-state release assets (no DENIED)
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      BILLING_TAG: billing-state-v1
    run: |
      set -euo pipefail
      python -m platform.billing.sanitize_release

This will:
- download billing-state-v1 assets
- replace any 'DENIED' values with policy-compliant values (status FAILED)
- regenerate state_manifest.json
- upload changed assets back to the release (delete + upload)

You can also run it manually in Actions by dispatching Maintenance, or by adding
a separate workflow_dispatch job that calls this module.
