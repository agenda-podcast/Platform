# PLATFORM

## Deterministic Agentic Workflows for Enterprise Execution

PLATFORM is a deterministic, auditable execution system that allows organizations to replace employee-driven operational processes with explicit, reproducible, and billable agentic workflows.

Unlike generic AI agents or ad-hoc automation, PLATFORM is designed as **infrastructure**, not experimentation. Every action is declared, executed, billed, and auditable. Billing is the source of truth. Execution is deterministic by design.

This repository represents a production-grade system for encoding work itself.

## Business Use Cases (Primary Value Creation)

PLATFORM is optimized for repeatable, high-frequency, compliance-sensitive work where human execution is expensive, inconsistent, and difficult to audit. These are workflows that organizations already run today, but inefficiently.

### Finance Operations (Treasury, Payments, Accounting)

Typical workflows include:

- Bank and payment statement ingestion, normalization, and reconciliation
- Exception identification and packaging for analyst review
- Period-end close support, including variance packs, commentary drafts, and evidence bundles
- Payment file validation, approval packaging, and release preparation

Business impact:

- Significant reduction in manual reconciliation effort
- Deterministic, audit-ready execution trails
- Lower operational risk from inconsistent human procedures
- Faster close cycles without incremental headcount

### Compliance, Controls, and Risk Operations

Typical workflows include:

- SOX and internal control testing execution
- Policy change detection and downstream impact analysis
- Scheduled evidence collection, scoring, and exception packaging
- Secure delivery of compliance artifacts to auditors or regulators

Business impact:

- Controls that execute the same way every time
- Reduced dependency on individual employee judgment
- Clear, reviewable evidence generated by design

### Customer Operations (Onboarding, Servicing, Support)

Typical workflows include:

- KYC and onboarding document processing and packaging
- Case file preparation and routing
- Ticket triage, classification, and response generation
- Secure customer communication delivery

Business impact:

- Faster cycle times and predictable service levels
- Consistent customer experience across teams
- Reduced load on high-cost frontline staff

### Content, Research, and Communications

Typical workflows include:

- Research ingestion and synthesis into reports or briefings
- Presentation, document, and media asset packaging
- Newsletter, briefing, or podcast production pipelines

Business impact:

- High-throughput content production with governance
- Elimination of manual tool coordination
- Consistent quality and format across outputs

### Reporting and Management Information

Typical workflows include:

- KPI pack generation
- Board and management reporting preparation
- Narrative and visual packaging of operational data

Business impact:

- Standardized reporting independent of individual contributors
- Reduced rework and spreadsheet dependency
- Faster, more reliable management insight delivery

## Financial Model and Estimates (Illustrative)

This section outlines a pragmatic, infrastructure-style financial model intended for investor discussion and internal planning. It reflects a usage-driven platform with strong operating leverage and expanding margins at scale.

### Commercial Structure

PLATFORM revenue is composed of three complementary layers:

| Revenue Layer | Description | Buyer Value |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Platform Subscription | Fixed monthly tenant license covering governance, orchestration, verification, and operational guarantees | Predictable baseline cost, enterprise-ready controls |
| Usage-Based Execution | Per-module and per-workflow execution fees | Pay only for realized throughput |
| Marketplace Modules | Developer-defined per-run pricing with automatic revenue sharing | Access to specialized capabilities without vendor sprawl |

This structure aligns cost directly with value delivered and enables clean ROI comparisons against labor.

### Example Planning Assumptions

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| Paying Tenants | 12 | 45 | 120 |
| Blended Avg MRR | $5.5k | $9k | $15k |

### Resulting ARR (Run-Rate, Approximate)

| Year | Approximate ARR |
|------|-----------------|
| Year 1 | ~$0.8M |
| Year 2 | ~$4.9M |
| Year 3 | ~$21.6M |

### Unit Economics Targets

- Gross margin target: **75–90 percent**
- Variable costs primarily driven by compute and third-party APIs
- Marketplace usage improves margin profile as execution volume scales

### ROI Framing for Buyers

A practical, repeatable ROI benchmark used in sales discussions:

- Workflow replaces 2 hours of daily manual work
- Fully loaded cost: ~$90 per hour
- Annual labor-equivalent value: ~$46,800 per workflow

At typical PLATFORM pricing levels, buyers achieve positive ROI while simultaneously improving audit posture, determinism, and operational scalability.

## Platform Components and Roles

PLATFORM is intentionally designed with strict separation of concerns. Each component has a single responsibility and well-defined boundaries. This structure is fundamental to determinism, auditability, and long-term maintainability.

### Modules

Modules are the atomic units of work.

Characteristics:

- Single-responsibility, functional execution units
- Declare all inputs, outputs, deliverables, and failure reasons explicitly
- Stateless and sandboxed
- Independently billable

Modules cannot access secrets, data, or resources beyond what is explicitly declared in their contract.

### Workorders

Workorders define orchestration intent.

Characteristics:

- Declare execution order and required inputs
- Contain no executable logic
- Never embed secrets

Workorders are portable, inspectable workflow definitions that encode business processes.

### Orchestrator

The orchestrator is the execution engine.

Responsibilities:

- Resolve step order and dependencies
- Execute modules deterministically
- Bind outputs from one step to inputs of the next
- Post all billable actions to Billing using idempotency keys

The orchestrator enforces rules but contains no business logic.

### Maintenance

Maintenance workflows:

- Regenerate deterministic indexes (modules, workorders, dropdowns)
- Enforce repository and configuration invariants

Maintenance is purely administrative and does not execute business workflows.

### Billing State

Billing is the canonical source of truth.

Characteristics:

- Append-only ledgers for transactions and transaction items
- Full visibility into spend, refunds, and execution outcomes
- Audit-ready by design

---

## Marketplace and Revenue Sharing

PLATFORM includes a first-class Modules Marketplace.

Marketplace model:

- External developers publish compliant modules
- Tenants compose workflows using marketplace modules
- Revenue is shared automatically per execution

Typical illustrative split:

- 70 percent to the module developer
- 30 percent to PLATFORM

Developers focus on functional value. PLATFORM handles billing, distribution, enforcement, and governance.

---

## Technical Architecture and Guarantees

### Determinism and Idempotency

- Identical inputs produce identical outputs
- Reruns do not duplicate charges
- Refunds are posted deterministically when applicable

### Secrets and Security

- Secrets are never hardcoded
- Modules declare required secrets in `module.yml`
- Secrets are injected via secretstore only

### Artifact Packaging and Delivery

- Packaging and delivery are explicit workflow steps
- No hidden or implicit execution
- Strict size, activation, and policy controls enforced

---

## Repository Structure

- `modules/<module_id>/` — functional modules with explicit contracts
- `tenants/<tenant_id>/workorders/` — workflow definitions
- `.billing-state/` — canonical billing and execution evidence
- `maintenance-state/` — deterministic indexes
- `docs/` — verification, schemas, and engineering rules

---

## Verification and Governance

PLATFORM provides three verification scopes:

- Verify Platform: repository invariants only
- Verify Modules: module self-test execution
- Verify Workorders: real end-to-end execution

Verification details are documented in `docs/verification.md`.

---

## PLATFORM in One Sentence

PLATFORM is an operating system for automated work, where intent becomes execution, execution becomes billing, and billing becomes truth.
