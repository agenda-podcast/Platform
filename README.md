# Orchestrator Preserve Dropdowns Patch

This patch intentionally does NOT replace the full orchestrator workflow.

Changes:
1. Keeps existing AUTOGENERATED dropdown blocks intact.
2. Adds artifact upload step for runtime evidence zips.
3. Uses billing_state_publish.py with --clobber (already provided separately).

Apply manually:
- Merge the workflow step block from docs below into your existing orchestrator.yml
