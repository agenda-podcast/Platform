This bundle aligns with your requirement:

- Maintenance is the ONLY place where module_prices coverage is enforced.
- Orchestrator should calculate spend using platform/billing/module_prices.csv (source-of-truth), not billing-state.
- Maintenance must NOT generate new runtime reports or new billing_state_seed artifacts.
- Defaults are configurable via platform/billing/billing_config.yaml:
    billing_defaults.default_price_run_credits
    billing_defaults.default_price_save_to_release_credits

What you need to update in your repo:
1) Add platform/billing/billing_config.yaml (or merge these keys into your existing config).
2) Add scripts/maintenance_prices.py and call it from Maintenance workflow before commit/push.
3) Update orchestrator module price loader to read platform/billing/module_prices.csv directly (see patches/orchestrator_module_prices.patch).
4) Update ci_verify PRE phase to verify coverage: every module folder ID has an effective+active price row (see patches/ci_verify_prices.patch).
